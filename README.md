# ü•ó KG for food: towards a nutrition information Knowledge Graph
A RDF Knowledge Graph for relevant information of food _e.g. Food CompositionData_.

## Objective

We will explore how food prices impose an insurmountable barrier to improve diet quality. Using domain specific ontology e.g. FoodOn ontology or ISO-FOOD ontology, we will work on the harmonisation and integration of multi-lingual FCD that will serve as inputs for a recommendation system based on KG, which integrate multiple food price data sources e.g. WFP to enrich semantic information. The ultimate goal is to produce a KG with more comprehensive nutrition and food price information to monitor change in food price for nutrition and analyse change in cost affordability of healthy diets.
